# Football Analytics Datavis Competition Entry
*By David Quartey*

*7th December, 2017*

This repo contains [R code](https://github.com/DavidQuartey/ggplot2_football_pitch/blob/master/statabet_pitch_dimensions.R) of STRATABET Pitch Dimensions used in my [Chance Analytics](https://chanceanalytics.wordpress.com/) Football Datavis Competition Entry.

The data viz highlights the goals of the only Ghanaian footballer in the Chinese Super League, Frank Acheampong. I wanted to bring out the quality of his goals (weighted by Expected Goals) and the channels through which heâ€™s typically fed with the ball whiles capturing this in an interesting way. The data viz works for both the average fan as well as player/opposition scouts at Football Clubs.

## Method
R is used to interpolate the path the ball travels between the pass location and the shot location. This assumes the ball travels in a straight line, which may not always be the case. It also assumes the shot is directed toward the centre of the goal, though in reality, it may differ due to shot placements, Goalkeeper positional awareness and many other situational factors.

Main R Packages used: `gganimate` for animating the data viz and `ggplot` for the STRATABET Pitch Dimensions.
The data used was kind courtesy of STRATABET.
